			<h2 class="left"> <b> What is Harkness? </b> Harkness is a discussion-based style of learning that puts students at the center. Students discuss their ideas in an open environment by actively collaborating to build new understandings. Teachers play the role of a guide rather than a lecturer to scaffold the learning that takes place around the Harkness table. </h2> <br>
			<h2 class="left"> <b> Why Harkness? </b> Harkness focuses on better student learning. Students learn better when they are able to interact and mentally wrestle with the material. The Harkness method allows students to work with their classmates to construct a shared understanding of the material. The animation above gives you easy ways to transform your classroom from a traditional, lecture-based classroom to a Harkness one. </h2> <br>
			<h2 class="left"> <b> What are the components of Harkness? </b> Most Harkness classrooms start around a<b> round table</b>. This makes it easy to see everyone and represents that everyone is an equal contributer to the learning process. This puts the teacher at the same level of the students and <b>gives students the control</b> of the direction the class will take. This way, students can discuss freely in an <b>accepting environment</b>. Conversation is stimulated by <b>engaging material</b> that is assigned and completed for homework to prime new ideas for class the next day. Students are inherently motivated to come prepared to class with relevant and meaningful questions. </h2> <br>

			<h2 class="left"> <b> What is Join the Table? </b> Join the Table is an online platform to help jumpstart your journey to transform your traditional classroom into a Harkness classroom.
